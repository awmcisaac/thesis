Thank you first, to my supervisors at the University of Trento, Prof. Raffaella
Bernardi and Prof. Paolo Rota, for introducing this engaging topic to me, and
helping to guide me through this thesis-writing process, and for providing me
access to compute clusters, without which I would not have been able to do this
work. Thank you also to my co-supervisor at Charles University, Doc. RNDr.
Ond\v{r}ej Bojar, and to all my professors who have taught me throughout this
program. I would also like to thank the Erasmus Mundus Language and
Communication Technologies program for generously providing me with a
scholarship during my Master's, and for giving me the opportunity to travel and
spend an extended period of time in two wonderful countries. 

But the places wouldn't be anything without the people you meet, so thank you
to the friends I have made along the way, for your support and kindness
throughout. Finally, thank you to my family, who have supported me from afar
over the last two years.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
Are vision and language models able to reason across time? We evaluate the
performance of vision and language models (VLMs) on the task of video question
answering, with a particular focus on their temporal reasoning abilities. We
probe the STAR video QA dataset on two VLMs with data perturbation methods of
text and video inputs, and find that models are generally unable to identify
the meaning of before and after in sequential questions. We then ask how a
model can effectively learn these temporal relations, and design a new dataset
drawn from videos and annotations from the Charades dataset. We create
annotations that include targeted hard negative examples for the contrastive
loss objective of one VLM, Merlot Reserve, such that the model must adapt to
learn temporal relations. We further explore how to model fine-grained temporal
relationships, and evaluate the benefits. We find that our approach shows
promising signs of improvement on tasks that require temporal understanding,
although it gains little sensitivity to temporal relations when probed.
