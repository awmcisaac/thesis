\section{Probing Temporal Ability}
\label{sec:prob}

\XXX{With the current limited writeup, Ondrej cannot comment yet. Some critical remarks: always try hard to complement other people's scores (which you can cite from a paper) with \emph{your own measurement} of their outputs. Typically, these reported and re-measured numbers will differ and it is always important to know them for a reliable comparison with your own scores.}

Table on changing temporal indicators improving performance on STAR
\begin{table}[htpb] 
    \centering 
    \caption{Results of Merlot Reserve on STAR dataset. Differences explained  
        by different sampling techniques I think, or question-statement 
        conversions. I took care to adapt the statements appropriately for verb 
        tense agreement. Also random seed may be different.For val, 43.01 mean 
        is weighted by num in each group.} 
    \label{tab:star} 
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccccc} 
        & Interaction & Sequence & Prediction & Feasibility & Mean \\
        \hline 
        Val & 43.12 & 42.33 & 43.27 & 47.14 & 43.01 (43.97) \\
        Test & 40.51 & 44.76 & 43.85 & 39.48 & 42.15 \\  
        Test Paper (B+audio) & 44.8 & 42.4 & 38.8 & 36.2 & 40.5 
    \end{tabular} 
\end{table} 

Switch before/after: 42.92 vs 42.33 with correct temporal ordering

Use before/after as MASKed answers: 50.86 (basically random)
